subtitle: Meet the kings of new york

description: When Kong came to the Big Apple, an icon was born. But what if a car could take over New York City?

With a host of innovative features for the ultimate passenger experience – including a panoramic roof – it’s no surprise that the NV200 is being hailed as the Taxi of Tomorrow.
