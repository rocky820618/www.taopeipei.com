title: The future of racing was a wing?
subtitle: DeltaWing

description: The DELTAWING is an experimental racecar even a caped crusader would envy. What truly sets the DELTAWING apart is that it weighs half as much and uses half the fuel, and goes just as fast as its competitors thanks to the powerful Nissan 1.6 litre DIG-T technology. If you missed the DELTAWING at 24 Hours of Le Mans, hop in, and see how it flies around the track.
